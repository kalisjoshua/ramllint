[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/ramllint.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/ramllint)

[RAML](http://raml.org) is a language for modeling RESTful APIs. By design,
it does not enforce any style rules on how to consistently document APIs,
because not all projects will require the same level of rule enforcement.
However, it can often be useful to enforce uniform rules and standards across a
group of related APIs to ensure consistency and uniformity across multiple teams
or business units.

RAML Linter is a static analysis, [linter-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29),
utility that will enforce rules on a given RAML document, ensuring
consistency and quality.

## Installing

````
npm install -g ramllint
````

## Using the Linter

RAML Linter can be used either as a library or as a command line utility.

### Library

Using the library in code provides the most flexibility, offering error
handling and the ability to parse the full results for: `error`, `warning`, and
`info` log entries.

```js
var Linter = require('ramllint'),

    ramllint = new Linter();

ramllint('./path/to/api.raml', function (log) {
  var errors = log.read('error');

  if (!errors.length) {
    // no errors, all rules are satisfied
  } else {
    // errors
  }
});
```

#### Rules

The default rules are included in the `src/defaults.json` file. You can make adjustments to the test used in the rule by passing options to the `Linter` constructor.

For example, if you'd like to change the rules for URL validation to permit `/sticky-wickets` and `/{stickyWicketId}`, you can do this:

```js
var Linter = require('ramllint'),
    options = {
        'url_lower': '^\\/([a-z]+(-[a-z]+)*|{[a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)*})$'
    },
    ramllint = new Linter(options);
```

Options need to be a JSON object with keys that match an id from the `defaults.json` file and values that are strings or string RegExp patterns.

### Command Line

If you are in the same directory as your RAML document:

```
ramllint
```

If your RAML document is in another directory:

```
ramllint path/to/api.raml
```

*Note: specifying the file (second example above) might be necessary for some OSes.*

## (`npm`) Scripts
